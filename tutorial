Building a basic microservice.

1. Build logic to persist model.
{
  "jsonelement1" : "value1",
  "jsonelement2" : "value2",
  ...
}

2. Build logic to persist multiple microservices

{
  "services": [
    {
      "url": "http://server:port/uri1",
      "body": {
        "jsonelement1": "value1",
        "jsonelement2": "value2"
        ...
      }
    },
    {
      "url": "http://server:port/uri1",
      "body": {
        "jsonelement1": "value1",
        "jsonelement2": "value2"
        ...
      }
    }
  ]
}


This structure will act as business model for each of your views. You can club microservices to reflect your business case in above format.

3. Build webservice backend
-Build logic to persist JSON document to appropriate table (in json serialized form, even for relational). 
JSON serialization gives greater flexibility to add or delete fields.
-Build index table persisting logic to get advantage of relational type querying.
-Build caching logic.
-Build validation logic as per your business case.
